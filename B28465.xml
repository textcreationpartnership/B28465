            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>PROPOSALS</hi> most humbly presented to the Honourable House of Commons, offering these, in hopes to serve his Majesty, by rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Supply on <hi>CATTLE,</hi> supposed only to be killed for Sale, whereby the Subject may be no ways opprest.</head>
            <p n="1">I. FOR <hi>Oxen, Steers, Bulls, Cows, Heiffers</hi> and <hi>Stucks,</hi> or by what other names they are distinguished, there is not, by modest computation, less killed, for the supply of the Cities of <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> and the liberties thereof, than 83200 <hi>Oxen</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per</hi> Year</p>
            <p>And I humbly suppose, if this number be kill'd in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. then for all <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Victualing of Shipping, not less than 12 times that number; which will amount in the Year to 998400 <hi>Oxen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And it may reasonably be supposed, the half of that number to be large-siz'd <hi>Cattle,</hi> whereof none doth weigh less than 8 C. weight; which if each of these were to pay 1 <hi>s.</hi> 7. <hi>d. per</hi> Head, it will come to no more than ⅔ of a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Stone, or the 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2; of a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Pound weight.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the small siz'd <hi>Cattle</hi> being the other half of the above number, and they weighing 5 C. weight at least; and if each of them were to pay 1 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Head, will be no more upon the Stone and Pound than before.</p>
            <p>The above number of <hi>Oxen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per</hi> Year, one with another, at the aforesaid Rate given, will amount to 68640 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. For <hi>Calves,</hi> by the least computation that can be given, there cannot be less killed in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. than 20800 <hi>per</hi> Year, and at this proportion in all <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. I may modestly account 6 times that Number, which will come to 124800 <hi>Calves per</hi> Year</p>
            <p>And supposing them to weigh one with another 2 C. weight at 4 <hi>d.</hi> 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>per</hi> Head, amounts to 2340 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> And exceeds not the former in the Stone or Pounds <hi>per</hi> price.</p>
            <p n="3">III. For <hi>Sheep,</hi> I think there may be computed to be killed in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. 1400000 <hi>per</hi> Year And if each of these weigh 21 Stone, Large and Small, one with another, at 3 <hi>d.</hi> ⅓ <hi>per</hi> Head, will bring in 20416 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Which will be in proportion on the Stone and Pound as the former.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For <hi>Hoggs</hi> and <hi>Shouts,</hi> I presume may reasonably be adjudged for the supply of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. and Shipping, 3 times the number of <hi>Oxen,</hi> &amp;c. which will amount in the Year to 2995200 <hi>Hoggs</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per</hi> Year</p>
            <p>And supposing them to weigh 36 Stone one with another at 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Head, comes to 74880 <hi>l. per An.</hi> not exceeding on the Stone and Pound as aforesaid.</p>
            <p n="5">V. For <hi>Lambs,</hi> by computation of those expended in the King's Houshold, I believe, by a modest account for supplying of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. 68000 <hi>per</hi> Year, and for all <hi>England,</hi> not less than 204000 <hi>per</hi> Year supposing them to weigh Young and Old 5 Stone, and at 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Head, amounts to 1700 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Which will not be the ⅙ part of a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Pound Weight.</p>
            <p>In this Estimate I presume not to give the true number of any sort of <hi>Cattle</hi> killed, but have taken such care that I verily believe if an accurate Inspection be made, I am below the number and have not exceeded the weight. I humbly suppose that at the aforesaid Rates, the Imposition will be so small <hi>per</hi> Head, that it will not amount to any more <hi>per</hi> Stone and Pound than what hath been before expressed; so at the said Rates, the Butcher, Retailer or Seller, cannot well exact on the Poor; and so inconsiderable a Price, that, I hope, to the Rich it is not worth taking notice of.</p>
            <p>I presume that if each of the aforesaid <hi>Cattle</hi> were to pay no more than ⅔ parts of a Farthing <hi>per</hi> Stone proportionable to their bigness, it will come to a far greater Sum <hi>per</hi> Year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereby may be raised a Fund of Mony, without (I hope) any Grievance to the Subject, amounting to,</hi> per Annum, 167976 <hi>l.</hi>
